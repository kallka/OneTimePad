# OneTimePad

Assignment: 
Create five small programs that encrypt and decrypt information using a one-time pad-like system. 
These programs will combine the multi-processing code with socket-based inter-process communication. 
Programs will also be accessible from the command line using standard Unix features like input/output redirection, and job control. 
Write a short compilation script.
